Thompson Reuters provides access to thousands of fundamental data points from the three main financial statements and beyond. Information includes typical standardized financial data such as earnings, dividends, and margins, but also contains sector specific data such as business and geographic segments, operating information (business intelligence), and major customers. TR prefers to deliver their data through an online SOAP-based API or XML structured files via FTP.

TR has become Elsen's primary provider, particularly for fundamental data and price information from the DataStream, WorldScope, and Reuters Knowledge Direct system.

Thomson Reuters offers a historical market data service called Thomson Reuters Tick History (TRTH). The data can be requested via a SOAP API or a web-based GUI. Files are delivered via FTP.

CAUTION: If a request is too large (say...more than 5GB), the request may be ignored. So, err on the small side with the number of securities and/or duration of history in each request.

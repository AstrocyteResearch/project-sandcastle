FactSet has an interesting dataset called [Revere](http://www.factset.com/campaigns/revere) that contain data on supply chain relationships, geographic revenue breakdowns, and detailed industry/sector information for companies. The data are delivered as a large collection of CSVs, or an install script that builds a Postgres database. They're structured as relational tables, but a graph format/structure may be more useful.

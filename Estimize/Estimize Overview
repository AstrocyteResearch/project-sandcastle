####Review on Estimize:
- Uncertainty of Estimize estimates
	- Our analysis from Estimize has shown that the range of EPS forecasted is much larger compared to Wall Street consensus.
	- More examples can be viewed [here](http://blog.estimize.com).                 
	
- Wisdom of the crowd?
	- Everyone can contribute to the pool of estimates regardless of the qualification. The community is split broadly among individual investors, buy-side and sell-side professionals.        
	- However, the estimates can be more independent than brokers, considering the potential conflicts of interests faced by analysts.
	- The company is newly established in 2011, will their methodology sustain throughout economic cycles?       
	  

- Research results from Deutsche Bank 
	- They did a statistical research on Estimize and Wall Street consensus (IBES).
	- Majority of Estimize forecasts are keyed in one week or a few days before the earnings announced rather than several weeks ahead by Wall Street analysts. The timeliness is a major reason why Estimize is more accurate 2/3 of the time when stocks are covered by more than 20 community analysts.
	- Performance comparison: 
		- As the time gets closer to the announcement date and more analysts cover the stock, Estimize forecasts become more accurate. 
		- One day or one week before the announcement: Estimaize outperforms; one month before the announcement: Wall Street consensus outperforms.
		- In Estimize, buy-side estimates are more accurate than the sell-side. However, IBES error rate is smaller than sell-side analysts from Estimize. This underlines more experienced analysts do not contribute to Estimize.
		- The reasons above also partly explain why Estimate non-professionals have better estimates than professionals.

- Short-term trading strategies based on Estimize estimates do generate positive alpha. Due to the diversity of views, it also appears to be a better market sentiment indicator reflected by the post earning trading results.

- Lastly, because of the timeliness and diversity, the estimates in the Estimize system may represent a distinct alternative to the Wall Street consensus.

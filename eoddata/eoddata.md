As of July 30, 2015 EODData is not part of the Sandbox - but they were pretty helpful to us for getting cheap equity price and volume data pretty quickly.

When we were just getting started and needed 'dummy' data, EODData was incredibly helpful to us. I wouldn't say the data is production ready and I wouldn't say that EODData has a great process but you can get equity price and volume pretty quickly and painlessly from them. One of the other nice things about the data is the straightforward pricing, $5/exchange/month. The files are returned in a CSV format, which makes it very easy to parse. A sample of the data has been placed into this folder.

According to their website:
"EODData is a leading provider of quality historical market data with easy to use download facilities at exceptional prices. Daily updates containing end of day quotes and intraday 1-minute bars can be downloaded automatically each day."

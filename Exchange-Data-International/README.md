####Data Formats
- Most datasets are provided as either fixed width or tab-delimited text files (see example data dictionaries below)
- As many datasets are provided as end-of-day (EOD) files, those files are incremental in nature. If relevant, all data for a given dataset can be provided at the outset
- Historical data is also available upon request

####Our Experience
EDI is very responsive and can provision requests to access to their FTP site and various datasets with a quick turnaround. Technical support reps will be assigned to you, so if you have specific questions you can work directly with the EDI team.

We're using two of EDI's datasets: securities reference data (security master) on global equities, and corporate actions data.

We download the data files for each dataset on an EOD basis. The filename for each file contains a numerical code that allows you to identify the related dataset. For example, the securities master files and coded "698" while the corporate actions files are coded "695".

The data dictionaries for both files are included as examples as follows:
- [Securities Master (698)](Feedformat_698_20140307.txt) 
- [Corporate Actions (695)](Feedformat_695_20150107.txt)

# Project Sandcastle
Git tracked security master and ingest scripts for a variety of financial data providers designed to facilitate financial data retrieval.

## Goals
- Create a high quality security master in an easily parseable (csv?) format for ALL securities worldwide
- Create/compile a set of easy-to-use (python?) scripts that will fetch data from the target providers and store them in a time series format (described in schema.sql)
- Document core features of each data source (distribution license, contact info, overarching description of available data sets)

## Target Supported Data Sets / Providers
- Fintech Sandbox partners (http://www.fintechsandbox.org/data-partners)
- Thomson Reuters
- Factset
- Six Financials
- Benzinga
- Stocktwits
- S&P
- Interactive Data
- Alexandria

## Data Series Design

For maintainability and ease of understanding, all data sets should be decomposed into single value time series. For example, a table such as 
```
alexandria_id, ts, alexandira.sentiment, alexandria.confidence, currentprice.val
34, 2008-01-01 09:00, 1, 0.81, 14.32
34, 2008-01-01 09:01, 1, 0.68, 14.35
62, 2008-01-01 09:00, -1, 0.31, 23.78
62, 2008-01-01 09:01, 0, 0.52, 24.29
```
should be broken into three time series like
```
alexandria_id, ts, alexandira.sentiment
34, 2008-01-01 09:00, 1
34, 2008-01-01 09:01, 1
62, 2008-01-01 09:00, -1
62, 2008-01-01 09:01, 0

alexandria_id, ts, alexandria.confidence
34, 2008-01-01 09:00, 0.81
34, 2008-01-01 09:01, 0.68
62, 2008-01-01 09:00, 0.31
62, 2008-01-01 09:01, 0.52

alexandria_id, ts, currentprice.val
34, 2008-01-01 09:00, 14.32
34, 2008-01-01 09:01, 14.35
62, 2008-01-01 09:00, 23.78
62, 2008-01-01 09:01, 24.29
```
where the id is converted to a listed identifier in the data_master table. If there is not yet an identifier for this object, a new one should be generated with the relevant details added. Each of the three time series should be "checked in" to the data_sets table, allowing for universal discoverability. The final result would be a data layout like:
```
# select id, display_name from dumptruck.data_master;

 id |            alexandria_id             
----+--------------------------------------
  1 | 				34
  2 | 				62

# select name,description from dumptruck.data_sets;

         name          |                       description                        
-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------
 alexandria_confidence | Confidence predictor derived from the Alexandria dataset
 alexandria_sentiment  | Sentiment score derived from the Alexandria dataset
 currentprice          | Closing price of day before derived from EODDATA dataset

# select * from dumptruck.alexandria_sentiment ;

----+---------------------+-----
  1 | 2008-01-01 09:00:00 |   1

  2 | 2008-01-01 09:00:00 | 0.31
  2 | 2008-01-01 09:01:00 | 0.52
  
# select * from dumptruck.currentprice ;

 id |         ts          |  val  
----+---------------------+-------
  1 | 2008-01-01 09:00:00 | 14.32
  1 | 2008-01-01 09:01:00 | 14.35
  2 | 2008-01-01 09:00:00 | 23.78
  2 | 2008-01-01 09:01:00 | 24.29
```

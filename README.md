# Project Sandcastle
Git tracked listing of data sources and descriptions designed to facilitate financial data retrieval by documenting the data sets available through the Fintech Sandbox to include provider information, ingest scripts, and example data. See http://www.fintechsandbox.org for more information. 

## Contribution Guidelines for today (1st Meeting)
1. Commit your descriptions in a file like `your_startup.md`. These will be combined into a single README following today's "hacking". In the future, all additions should be directly to this README, but for today we're keeping things separate to avoid any collisions. 
2. Contributions should detail any/some/all of the following items:
- Which data sets you're currently using and how you're accessing them
- How you're using said data sets
- General experience with the data set and tips to facilitate the process for new startups
- Addition of example data sets or ingest scripts that you found helpful
